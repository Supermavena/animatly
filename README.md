# Lottie light for Web,

## This is a light version of lottie I choose from the whole AIRBNB lottie package. This is the svg version of lottie.

## This is 50% smaller than the full lottie verison if you need a lighter version of lottie you can use this.

File: ./build/player/lottie_svg.min.js

```bash
npm install lottie-web
```
